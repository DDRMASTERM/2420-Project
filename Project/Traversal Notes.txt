Graph traversal:

BST traversal: inorder traversal

Linked List traversal: start at beginning and keep applying getNext

Stack traversal: not a typical operation
Queue traversal: same

Hash table traversal: linear examination of buckets

Heap traversal: not a typical operation.

We need to be able to traverse graphs.
Depth first search
Breadth first search

DFS rules:
0: Put any vertex to start with. Visit it, mark it, and push its label onto the stack
1: If possible, visit an unvisited adjacent vertex, mark it, and push its label onto a stack.
2: If 1 is impossible, then pop a vertex of the stack, if possible.
3: If 1 and 2 are impossible, you are done.
